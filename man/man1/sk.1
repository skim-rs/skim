.SH DESCRIPTION
sk \- fuzzy finder in Rust
.PP
sk is a general purpose command\-line fuzzy finder.
.PP
.PP
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
     SKIM_DEFAULT_COMMAND
.PP
         Default command to use when input is tty. On *nix systems, sk runs the command with sh \-c, so make  sure  that
         it\*(Aqs POSIX\-compliant.
.PP
     SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS
.PP
         Default options. e.g. export SKIM_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="\-\-multi
.PP
 EXTENDED SEARCH MODE
.PP
      Unless specified otherwise, sk will start in "extended\-search mode". In this mode, you can specify multiple  patterns
      delimited by spaces, such as: \*(Aqwild ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !rmx
.PP
      You can prepend a backslash to a space (\\ ) to match a literal space character.
.PP
  Exact\-match (quoted)
.PP
      A  term that is prefixed by a single\-quote character (\*(Aq) is interpreted as an "exact\-match" (or "non\-fuzzy") term. sk
      will search for the exact occurrences of the string.
.PP
  Anchored\-match
.PP
      A term can be prefixed by ^, or suffixed by $ to become an anchored\-match term. Then sk will  search  for  the  lines
      that start with or end with the given string. An anchored\-match term is also an exact\-match term.
.PP
  Negation
.PP
      If  a  term  is prefixed by !, sk will exclude the lines that satisfy the term from the result. In this case, sk per‐
      forms exact match by default.
.PP
  Exact\-match by default
.PP
      If you don\*(Aqt prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to "quote" (prefixing with \*(Aq) every word,  start  sk  with  \-e  or
      \-\-exact option. Note that when \-\-exact is set, \*(Aq\-prefix "unquotes" the term.
.PP
  OR operator
.PP
      A  single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with
      core and end with either go, rb, or py.
.PP
      e.g. ^core go$ | rb$ | py$
.PP
.PP
EXIT STATUS
    0      Normal exit
    1      No match
    2      Error
    130    Interrupted with CTRL\-C or ESC
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-tac\fR
Show results in reverse order

Often used in combination with \-\-no\-sort
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-sort\fR
Do not sort the results

Often used in combination with \-\-tac Example: `history | sk \-\-tac \-\-no\-sort`
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tiebreak\fR=\fITIEBREAK\fR [default: score,begin,end]

\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-nth\fR=\fINTH\fR [default: ]
Fields to be matched

A field index expression can be a non\-zero integer or a range expression ([BEGIN]..[END]). \-\-nth

**Examples:**
    1      The 1st field
    2      The 2nd field
    \-1     The last field
    \-2     The 2nd to last field
    3..5   From the 3rd field to the 5th field
    2..    From the 2nd field to the last field
    ..\-3   From the 1st field to the 3rd to the last field
    ..     All the fields

\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bind\fR=\fIBIND\fR
Comma separated list of bindings

You can customize key bindings of sk with \-\-bind option which takes a  comma\-separated  list  of
key binding expressions. Each key binding expression follows the following format: KEY:ACTION

    yank                  ctrl\-y

Multiple actions can be chained using + separator.

    sk \-\-bind \*(Aqctrl\-a:select\-all+accept\*(Aq

With  execute(...)  action,  you can execute arbitrary commands without leaving sk. For example,
you can turn sk into a simple file browser by binding enter key to less command like follows.

    sk \-\-bind "enter:execute(less {})"

You can use the same placeholder expressions as in \-\-preview.

If the command contains parentheses, sk may fail to parse the expression. In that case, you  can
use any of the following alternative notations to avoid parse errors.

    execute[...]
    execute\*(Aq...\*(Aq
    execute"..."
    execute:...
       This is the special form that frees you from parse errors as it does not expect the clos‐
       ing character. The catch is that it should be the last one in the comma\-separated list of
       key\-action pairs.

sk  switches  to  the  alternate screen when executing a command. However, if the command is ex‐
pected to complete quickly, and you are not interested in its output, you might want to use exe‐
cute\-silent instead, which silently executes the command without the  switching.  Note  that  sk
will  not  be  responsive  until the command is complete. For asynchronous execution, start your
command as a background process (i.e. appending &).

With if\-query\-empty and if\-query\-not\-empty action, you could specify the action to  execute  de‐
pends on the query condition. For example

    sk \-\-bind \*(Aqctrl\-d:if\-query\-empty(abort)+delete\-char\*(Aq

If  the query is empty, skim will execute abort action, otherwise execute delete\-char action. It
is equal to ‘delete\-char/eof‘.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-multi\fR
Enable multiple selection

Uses Tab and S\-Tab by default for selection
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-multi\fR
Disable multiple selection
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-mouse\fR
Disable mouse
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cmd\fR=\fICMD\fR
Command to invoke dynamically in interactive mode

Will be invoked using `sh \-c`
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
Run in interactive mode
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR=\fICOLOR\fR
Set color theme

Format: [BASE][,COLOR:ANSI]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-hscroll\fR
Disable horizontal scroll
.TP
\fB\-\-keep\-right\fR
Keep the right end of the line visible on overflow

Effective only when the query string is empty
.TP
\fB\-\-skip\-to\-pattern\fR=\fISKIP_TO_PATTERN\fR
Show the matched pattern at the line start

Line  will  start  with  the  start of the matched pattern. Effective only when the query
string is empty. Was designed to skip showing starts of paths of rg/grep results.

e.g. sk \-i \-c "rg {} \-\-color=always" \-\-skip\-to\-pattern \*(Aq[^/]*:\*(Aq \-\-ansi
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-clear\-if\-empty\fR
Do not clear previous line if the command returns an empty result

Do not clear previous items if new command returns empty result. This might be useful  to
reduce flickering when typing new commands and the half\-complete commands are not valid.

This is not default however because similar usecases for grep and rg had already been op‐
timized  where  empty  result  of  a query do mean "empty" and previous results should be
cleared.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-clear\-start\fR
Do not clear items on start
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-clear\fR
Do not clear screen on exit

Do not clear finder interface on exit. If skim was started in full screen mode, it will not switch back to the original  screen, so you\*(Aqll have to manually run tput rmcup to return. This option can be used to avoid flickering of the screen when your application needs to start skim multiple times in order.
.TP
\fB\-\-show\-cmd\-error\fR
Show error message if command fails

The  given  string  will  be printed as the sticky header. The lines are displayed in the given order from top to bottom regardless of \-\-layout option, and  are  not  affected  by \-\-with\-nth. ANSI color codes are processed even when \-\-ansi is not set.
.TP
\fB\-\-header\-lines\fR=\fIHEADER_LINES\fR [default: 0]
Number of lines of the input treated as header

The  first N lines of the input are treated as the sticky header. When \-\-with\-nth is set, the lines are transformed just like the other lines that follow.
.TP
\fB\-\-history\fR=\fIHISTORY\fR
History file

Load search history from the specified file and update the file on completion. When enabled, CTRL\-N and CTRL\-P are automatically remapped to next\-history and previous\-history.
.TP
\fB\-\-history\-size\fR=\fIHISTORY_SIZE\fR [default: 1000]
Maximum number of query history entries to keep
.TP
\fB\-\-cmd\-history\fR=\fICMD_HISTORY\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-preview\fR=\fIPREVIEW\fR
Preview command

Execute the given command for the current line and display the result on the preview window. {} in the command
is the placeholder that is replaced to the single\-quoted string of the current line. To transform the replace‐
ment string, specify field index expressions between the braces (See FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION for the details).

e.g. sk \-\-preview=\*(Aqhead \-$LINES {}\*(Aq
     ls \-l | sk \-\-preview="echo user={3} when={\-4..\-2}; cat {\-1}" \-\-header\-lines=1

sk overrides $LINES and $COLUMNS so that they represent the exact size of the preview window.

A placeholder expression starting with + flag will be replaced to the space\-separated  list  of  the  selected
lines (or the current line if no selection was made) individually quoted.

e.g.
     sk \-\-multi \-\-preview=\*(Aqhead \-10 {+}\*(Aq
     git log \-\-oneline | sk \-\-multi \-\-preview \*(Aqgit show {+1}\*(Aq

Note that you can escape a placeholder pattern by prepending a backslash.

Also,  {q}  is replaced to the current query string. {cq} is replaced to the current command query string. {n}
is replaced to zero\-based ordinal index of the line. Use {+n} if you want  all  index  numbers  when  multiple
lines are selected

Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for the current query if any of the placeholder ex‐
pressions evaluates to a non\-empty string.
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\-window\fR=\fIPREVIEW_WINDOW\fR [default: right:50%]
Preview window layout

Format: [up|down|left|right][:SIZE[%]][:hidden][:+SCROLL[\-OFFSET]] Determine  the  layout of the preview window. If the argument ends with :hidden, the preview window will be hidden by default until toggle\-preview action is triggered. Long lines are truncated by default.  Line wrap can be enabled with :wrap flag.

If size is given as 0, preview window will not be visible, but sk will still execute the command in the background.

+SCROLL[\-OFFSET] determines the initial scroll offset of the preview window. SCROLL can be either a  numeric  integer or  a  single\-field index expression that refers to a numeric integer. The optional \-OFFSET part is for adjusting the base offset so that you can see the text above it. It should be given as a numeric integer (\-INTEGER), or as a denom‐ inator form (\-/INTEGER) for specifying a fraction of the preview window height.

e.g. # Non\-default scroll window positions and sizes sk \-\-preview="head {}" \-\-preview\-window=up:30% sk \-\-preview="file {}" \-\-preview\-window=down:2

# Initial scroll offset is set to the line number of each line of # git grep output *minus* 5 lines (\-5) git grep \-\-line\-number \*(Aq\*(Aq | sk \-\-delimiter : \-\-preview \*(Aqnl {1}\*(Aq \-\-preview\-window +{2}\-5

# Preview with bat, matching line in the middle of the window (\-/2) git grep \-\-line\-number \*(Aq\*(Aq | sk \-\-delimiter : \\ \-\-preview \*(Aqbat \-\-style=numbers \-\-color=always \-\-highlight\-line {2} {1}\*(Aq \\ \-\-preview\-window +{2}\-/2

.TP
\fB\-\-expect\fR=\fIEXPECT\fR
Comma separated list of keys used to complete skim

Comma\-separated  list  of keys that can be used to complete sk in addition to the default enter key. When this option is set, sk will print the name of the key pressed as the first line of its output  (or  as  the  second line  if \-\-print\-query is also used). The line will be empty if sk is completed with the default enter key. If \-\-expect option is specified multiple times, sk will expect the union of the keys. \-\-no\-expect will clear  the list.
